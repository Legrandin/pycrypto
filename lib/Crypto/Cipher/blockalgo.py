#: *Electronic Code Book (ECB)*.
#: This is the simplest encryption mode. Each of the plaintext blocks
#: is directly encrypted into a ciphertext block, independently of
#: any other block. This mode exposes frequency of symbols
#: in your plaintext. Other modes (e.g. *CBC*) should be used instead.
#:
#: See `NIST SP800-38A`_ , Section 6.1 .

MODE_ECB = 1

#: *Cipher-Block Chaining (CBC)*. Each of the ciphertext blocks depends
#: on the current and all previous plaintext blocks. An Initialization Vector
#: (*IV*) is required.
#:
#: The *IV* is a data block to be transmitted to the receiver.
#: The *IV* can be made public, but it must be authenticated by the receiver and
#: it should be picked randomly.
#:
#: See `NIST SP800-38A`_ , Section 6.2 .
#:
#: .. _`NIST SP800-38A` : http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-38a/sp800-38a.pdf
MODE_CBC = 2

#: *Cipher FeedBack (CFB)*. This mode is similar to CBC, but it transforms
#: the underlying block cipher into a stream cipher. Plaintext and ciphertext
#: are processed in *segments* of **s** bits. The mode is therefore sometimes
#: labelled **s**-bit CFB. An Initialization Vector (*IV*) is required.
#:
#: When encrypting, each ciphertext segment contributes to the encryption of
#: the next plaintext segment.
#:
#: This *IV* is a data block to be transmitted to the receiver.
#: The *IV* can be made public, but it should be picked randomly.
#: Reusing the same *IV* for encryptions done with the same key lead to
#: catastrophic cryptographic failures.
#:
#: See `NIST SP800-38A`_ , Section 6.3 .

MODE_PGP = 4

#: *Output FeedBack (OFB)*. This mode is very similar to CBC, but it
#: transforms the underlying block cipher into a stream cipher.
#: The keystream is the iterated block encryption of an Initialization Vector (*IV*).
#:
#: The *IV* is a data block to be transmitted to the receiver.
#: The *IV* can be made public, but it should be picked randomly.
#:
#: Reusing the same *IV* for encryptions done with the same key lead to
#: catastrophic cryptograhic failures.
#:
#: See `NIST SP800-38A`_ , Section 6.4 .

MODE_OFB = 5

#: *CounTeR (CTR)*. This mode is very similar to ECB, in that
#: encryption of one block is done independently of all other blocks.
#: Unlike ECB, the block *position* contributes to the encryption and no
#: information leaks about symbol frequency.
#:
#: Each message block is associated to a *counter* which must be unique
#: across all messages that get encrypted with the same key (not just within
#: the same message). The counter is as big as the block size.
#:
#: Counters can be generated in several ways. The most straightword one is
#: to choose an *initial counter block* (which can be made public, similarly
#: to the *IV* for the other modes) and increment its lowest **m** bits by
#: one (modulo *2^m*) for each block. In most cases, **m** is chosen to be half
#: the block size.
#: 
#: Reusing the same *initial counter block* for encryptions done with the same
#: key lead to catastrophic cryptograhic failures.
#:
#: See `NIST SP800-38A`_ , Section 6.5 (for the mode) and Appendix B (for how
#: to manage the *initial counter block*).

MODE_CTR = 6

#: *OpenPGP CFB*. This mode is a variant of CFB, and it is only used in PGP and OpenPGP_ applications.
#: An Initialization Vector (*IV*) is required.
#: 
#: Unlike CFB, the IV is not transmitted to the receiver. Instead, the *encrypted* IV is.
#: The IV is a random data block. Two of its bytes are duplicated to act as a checksum
#: for the correctness of the key. The encrypted IV is therefore 2 bytes longer than
#: the clean IV.
#:
#: .. _OpenPGP: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880
MODE_OPENPGP = 7

#: *Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM)*. This is an Authenticated Encryption with
#: Associated Data (`AEAD`_) mode. It provides both confidentiality and authenticity.
#: The header of the message may be left in the clear, if needed, and it will
#: still be subject to authentication. The decryption step tells the receiver
#: if the message comes from a source that really knowns the secret key.
#: Additionally, decryption detects if any part of the message - including the
#: header - has been modified or corrupted.
#:
#: This mode requires a nonce (or *IV*). The nonce shall never repeat for two
#: different messages encrypted with the same key, but it does not need to be random. 
#: Note that there is a trade-off between the size of the nonce and the
#: maximum size of a single message you can encrypt.
#:
#: It is important to use a large nonce if the key is reused across several
#: messages and the nonce is chosen randomly.
#:
#: It is acceptable to us a short nonce if the key is only used a few times or if the
#: nonce is taken from a counter.
#:
#: The following table shows the trade-off when the nonce is chosen at
#: random. The column on the left shows how many messages it takes
#: for the keystream to repeat **on average**. In practice, you will want to
#: stop using the key way before that.
